    <p>Joshy Soul is an artist who finds his stride amongst the things he knows best: art and soul. As a performer, writer, producer, art director, stylist, fashion model, and roller-skating provocateur, his medium traverses first note to the last, first thread to final seam, and curtain draws to fall. His craft of art and soul varies as much as the clothes he struts. Through Joshy's love of skating and fashion, he has planted himself in the modeling and influencing zeitgeist as one that evokes feeling through the way he dresses and the way he moves.</p>
